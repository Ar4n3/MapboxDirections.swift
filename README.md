MapboxDirections.swift
======================

[![Build Status](https://www.bitrise.io/app/2f82077d3f083479.svg?token=mC783nGMKA3XrvcMCJAOLg&branch=master)](https://www.bitrise.io/app/2f82077d3f083479)

[Mapbox Directions](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/directions/) for Swift. 

Meant for use as as drop-in replacement for Apple's `MKDirections` API, but it doesn't need MapKit. 

### Tests

To run the included unit tests, you need to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to install the dependencies. 

1. `pod install`
1. `open Directions Example.xcworkspace`
1. `Command+U` or `xcodebuild test`
