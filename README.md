MapboxDirections.swift
======================

[Mapbox Directions](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/directions/) for Swift. 

Requires [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON), which is referenced as a submodule (i.e. `git submodule update --init`). 

Meant for use as as drop-in replacement for Apple's `MKDirections` API, but it doesn't need MapKit.
